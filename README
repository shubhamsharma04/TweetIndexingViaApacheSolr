############ WARNING ############
This is a hobby project and is far from optimized.

Now that you have been warned :-

This setup consists of three components:-

1) TweetStreaming:-
	A maven project to collect and store tweets pertaining to certain filters like language, keywords etc in a json file. It DOESN'T store the entire tweet json as returned by twitter4j but only certain fields. Build it via maven, run it via java -jar 'jarName', stop it via CTRL-C(sorry)
	
2) TweetFormatting:-
	A maven project to format the tweets collected by TweetStreaming so that te resultant json file ca be indexed in a preconfigured instance of Apache Solr.(See 3)
	
3) ApacheSolrConf:- 
	I have included the managed-schema file containing configurations of solr instance(>=6.2.0). Among other things, I use korean stopwords and a different file for Spanish Stopwords(Both are included in lang folder).
